# Web-automation-using-python-selenium

Graduated months ago as an industrial engineer, so i found myself checking the status of my diploma rather frequently.
I decided to automate the whole process with this script, clicking buttons, loging in, extracting the status. 
Now i dont have to waste time checking for it manually, i can run the script in just seconds and do other things.
For obvious reasons i didnt include my real user and pass.
